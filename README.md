# Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews  

Sentiment Analysis is an NLP application that identifies a text corpus’s emotional or sentimental tone or opinion. Usually, emotions or attitudes towards a topic can be positive, negative, or neutral. This makes sentiment analysis a text classification task. Examples of positive and negative expressions are:
“I enjoyed the movie!” – Positive
“It was the most terrible movie I have ever seen.” – Negative
