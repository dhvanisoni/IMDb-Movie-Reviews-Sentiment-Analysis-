###üöÄ Steps Followed: 

1. Getting and Loading the Dataset
2. Text Processing
3. Model Building
4. Hyperparameter Tunining
5. Model Evaluation and Comparision
6. Model Improvment


### Model Architectures
We thoroughly investigated RNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, and a novel hybrid framework combining CNN and Bidirectional LSTM. A comparative analysis was conducted to gauge the efficacy of each model architecture.

### üîç Results and Findings:

Hybrid Convolutional-BiLSTM model showcased the highest accuracy at 89%.
LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 86%.
CNN+LSTM model's performance underscored the importance of hyperparameter tuning and architectural design.
